# Investment Principles

Synthesized rules learned from experience. Each principle tracks its origin and validation history.

## Thesis Quality

### P1: Insider experience is high-signal for conviction adjustment
**Origin:** QCOM/META thesis updates (2026-02-02)
**Validated:** 0 times

Firsthand work experience provides leading indicators that don't appear in financial statements:
- **Positive signals:** Execution speed, accountability culture, aggressive opportunity capture
- **Negative signals:** Short-term stock price focus, talent drain, dysfunctional processes

When you have insider experience with a company, it should meaningfully adjust conviction:
- Strong culture/execution → raise conviction
- Red flags (talent leaving, politics over performance) → lower conviction

### P2: Culture that's hard to work in often correlates with shareholder returns
**Origin:** META thesis update (2026-02-02)
**Validated:** 0 times

Cutthroat performance cultures create workplaces that are stressful but effective. The same pressure that makes employees uncomfortable often drives the results that benefit shareholders. Don't confuse "nice place to work" with "good investment."

### P3: Domain expertise creates durable edge — lean into it
**Origin:** Discovery session (2026-02-02) — user's AI SW/HW codesign expertise
**Validated:** 2 times (AMD inference thesis, GOOGL transformer thesis)

When you have deep domain expertise:
- Your contrarian views are more likely correct than the market's consensus
- Early calls (AMD inference, GOOGL transformers) were right because of technical understanding
- Lean into this edge — size positions larger when your domain expertise supports the thesis

Examples of domain-informed insights:
- Inference is easier than training → NVDA replaceable for inference workloads
- Inference is growing % of AI costs → opportunity for inference-optimized players
- Rigid HW-first companies (Intel) won't survive SW/HW codesign era

### P4: Avoid legacy tech companies with rigid structures
**Origin:** Discovery session (2026-02-02) — user's view on Intel
**Validated:** 0 times

Old tech companies with hardware-first cultures and rigid organizational structures are unlikely to adapt to the new era of SW/HW codesign. The agility required to iterate on software-defined hardware is incompatible with traditional chip development cycles.

**Applies to:** Intel, and potentially other legacy semiconductor companies
