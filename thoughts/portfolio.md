## Tax Lot Selection Strategy

For tax-optimized selling, consider:
1. **Long-term lots first** - Lower capital gains tax rate (0/15/20% vs ordinary income)
2. **Highest cost basis** - Minimizes taxable gain
3. **Specific lot identification** - Specify lots when selling for tax control

Current long-term lots:
- META: 67 shares @ $577.16 (acquired 2024-11-15)
- QCOM: 46 shares @ $151.96 (acquired 2024-02-20)
